Hint
Given two positive integers n and x.

Return the number of ways n can be expressed as the sum of the xth power of unique positive integers, in other words, the number of sets of unique integers [n1, n2, ..., nk] where n = n1x + n2x + ... + nkx.

Since the result can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

For example, if n = 160 and x = 3, one way to express n is n = 23 + 33 + 53.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, x = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: We can express n as the following: n = 32 + 12 = 10.
It can be shown that it is the only way to express 10 as the sum of the 2nd power of unique integers.
Example 2:

Input: n = 4, x = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: We can express n in the following ways:
- n = 41 = 4.
- n = 31 + 11 = 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 300
1 <= x <= 5

        // dp[i][j] = k: There are k ways to express i using j as the max element.
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for(int j = 1; j <= n; j++){
            long isPow = (long)Math.pow(j, x);
            for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++){
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1];
                if(i >= isPow){
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - (int)isPow][j - 1]) % MOD;
                }

        return dp[n][n];
